# AR-Project-Year2
This is a repository for a *Unity Augmented Reality Experience*

The main scene for this repo is located as ar-project-year2 within the Scenes folder.

This experience requires an **Android** device to be built on.
#

Once the build is loaded on Android, there is a UI interface that can be disabled. 

The AR-Project-Year2 Scene requires the marker image to be scanned. 
The marker image can be found within Assets -> Images -> ReferenceImageLibrary.

When the marker image is recognised, a 3d model appears on top of it. This model can have its hair colour toggled between two colours when pressed. A sound will also play when the hair is changed to pink.
